# Project
Currently my project is working with hyperspectral satellite data from PRISMA to analyze the different ecosystems in the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. One of the goals of this project is to analyze the reflectance compared to time since fire data for the region in each of the ecosystems.
